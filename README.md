# K-News-Stance

This repository introduces K-News-Stance, the first Korean dataset for article-level news stance detection. Alongside this method we propose JoA-ICL, an agentic in-context learning approach that predicts article-level stance by leveraging segment-level stance predictions generated by a language model agent.

Code, dataset, and guideline will be released upon paper acceptance.
