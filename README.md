# Journalism-Guided Agentic In-Context Learning for News Stance Detection

This repository introduces K-News-Stance, the first Korean dataset for article-level news stance detection. Alongside this dataset we propose JoA-ICL, an agentic in-context learning approach that predicts article-level stance by leveraging segment-level stance predictions generated by a language model agent.

## Task: News Stance Detection
We address the task of **stance detection in news articles**, which involves identifying the positional stance of a news article toward a given social issue.  

- **Input**  
  - News article *A*  
  - Target issue *T*  

- **Output**  
  - Stance label *L* ∈ { *supportive*, *neutral*, *oppositional* }  

- **Objective**  
  Given *(A, T)*, predict the overall stance *L* of article *A* toward issue *T*.  
  
## Dataset: K-News-Stance
We introduce a dataset of 2,000 news articles for detecting news stance.
All the data is contained within the file data/k-news-stance.json. The data is structured as following:
```json
{
    "issue": "노란봉투법 국회 상임위 통과",
    "id": 728,
    "headline": "...",
    "press": "...",
    "date": "...",
    "url": "...",
    "lead": "...",
    "article": "...",
    "conclusion": "...",

    "genre": "...",
    "headline_stance": "중립적",
    "lead_stance": "중립적",
    "conclusion_stance": "지지적",
    "article_stance": "중립적",
    "quotations": [
        {
            "quote": "...",
            "quote_stance": ["중립적"]
        },
        {
            "quote": "...",
            "quote_stance": ["비판적"]
        },
        {
            "quote": "...",
            "quote_stance": ["지지적"]
        }
    ],

    "split_99": "test",
},
{
    ...
}

```
