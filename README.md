# Journalism-Guided Agentic In-Context Learning for News Stance Detection

This repository introduces **K-News-Stance**, the first Korean dataset for article-level news stance detection. Alongside this dataset, we propose **JoA-ICL**, an agentic in-context learning approach that predicts article-level stance by leveraging segment-level stance predictions generated by a language model agent.

## Task: News Stance Detection
We address the task of **stance detection in news articles**, which involves identifying the positional stance of a news article toward a given social issue.

- **Input**
  - News article *A*
  - Target issue *T*

- **Output**
  - Stance label *L* ∈ { *supportive*, *neutral*, *oppositional* }

- **Objective**  
  Given *(A, T)*, predict the overall stance *L* of article *A* toward issue *T*.

**K-News-Stance** contains **2,000 Korean news articles** annotated with:
- Article-level stance  
- Segment-level stance (headline, lead, quotations, conclusion)  
- Metadata (news outlet, genre, date, link, etc.)

## 🧠 Method: JoA-ICL (Journalism-Guided Agentic In-Context Learning)
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ssu-humane/K-News-Stance/blob/main/joa-icl.jpg" width="900" height="400"></p>
As illustrated in Figure, this LLM-based method performs article-level stance prediction via in-context learning while delegating stance classification of journalism-guided segments—such as leads and quotations—to a language model(LM) agent. 
The resulting segment-level predictions are then integrated with the primary LLM, enabling more accurate inference of an article’s overall stance toward a target issue.

## ▶ How to Run

python joa-icl.py
```

    abstract = "As online news consumption grows, personalized recommendation systems have become integral to digital journalism. However, these systems risk reinforcing filter bubbles and political polarization by failing to incorporate diverse perspectives. Stance detection{---}identifying a text{'}s position on a target{---}can help mitigate this by enabling viewpoint-aware recommendations and data-driven analyses of media bias. Yet, existing stance detection research remains largely limited to short texts and high-resource languages. To address these gaps, we introduce K-News-Stance, the first Korean dataset for article-level stance detection, comprising 2,000 news articles with article-level and 21,650 segment-level stance annotations across 47 societal issues. We also propose JoA-ICL, a \textbf{Jo}urnalism-guided \textbf{A}gentic \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{L}earning framework that employs a language model agent to predict the stances of key structural segments (e.g., leads, quotes), which are then aggregated to infer the overall article stance. Experiments showed that JoA-ICL outperforms existing stance detection methods, highlighting the benefits of segment-level agency in capturing the overall position of long-form news articles. Two case studies further demonstrate its broader utility in promoting viewpoint diversity in news recommendations and uncovering patterns of media bias."
