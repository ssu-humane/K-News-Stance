# Journalism-Guided Agentic In-Context Learning for News Stance Detection

This repository introduces K-News-Stance, the first Korean dataset for article-level news stance detection. Alongside this dataset we propose JoA-ICL, an agentic in-context learning approach that predicts article-level stance by leveraging segment-level stance predictions generated by a language model agent.

## Task: News Stance Detection
task definition

## Dataset: K-News-Stance
We introduce a dataset of 2,000 news articles for detecting news stance.
All the data is contained within the file data/k-news-stance.json. The data is structured as following:
```python
dataset = [
    {
        "issue": "노란봉투법 국회 상임위 통과",
        "id": 728,
        "headline": "...",
        "press": "...",
        "date": "...",
        "url": "...",
        "lead": "...",
        "article": "...",
        "conclusion": "...",

        "genre": "...",
        "headline_stance": "중립적",
        "lead_stance": "중립적",
        "conclusion_stance": "지지적",
        "overall_stance": "중립적",
        "quotations": [
            {
                "quote": "...",
                "quote_stance": ["중립적"]
            },
            {
                "quote": "...",
                "quote_stance": ["비판적"]
            },
            {
                "quote": "...",
                "quote_stance": ["지지적"]
            }
        ],

        "split_99": "test",
    },
    {
        ...
    }
]

```
