# Journalism-Guided Agentic In-Context Learning for News Stance Detection

This repository introduces K-News-Stance, the first Korean dataset for article-level news stance detection. Alongside this dataset we propose JoA-ICL, an agentic in-context learning approach that predicts article-level stance by leveraging segment-level stance predictions generated by a language model agent.

Code, dataset, and guideline will be released upon paper acceptance.
