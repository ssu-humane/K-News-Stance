# News Stance Labeling Task Guideline

## Objective
The objective is to read a full news article on a specific target issue and determine whether the stance of the news article towards the issue is supportive, neutral, or oppositional.

## Notes
- Thank you for your help with the labeling task. Please read the instructions below carefully before you begin.
- If a stance is ambiguous, review other articles on the same issue and then return to label it. Consider if it is relatively skewed towards one side.
- Opinions can vary from person to person. Consider "How might others think?" before answering.

## Labeling Method
### 1. Read the article and classify its genre.
> Q1. What is the genre of the article?  
> a. Straight news | b. Analysis | c. Opinion | d. Other (e.g., interviews, photo articles, broadcast reports)
-   **Straight news**: Factual reporting that objectively conveys facts without interpretation.
-   **Analysis**: Articles that extend beyond factual reporting to include context, implications, issue organization, or future scenarios.
-   **Opinion**: Articles predominantly expressing subjective opinions or interpretations.
-   **Other**: Interviews, photo articles, broadcast reports, etc.

### 2. (If the genre is analysis or opinion) Read each component of the article and determine the stance of the text towards the given issue.
> Q2. What is the stance of the headline toward the issue?  
> a. Supportive | b. Neutral | c. Oppositional

> Q3. What is the stance of the lead toward the issue?  
> a. Supportive | b. Neutral | c. Oppositional

> Q4. What is the stance of the conclusion toward the issue?  
> a. Supportive | b. Neutral | c. Oppositional

### 3. Mark the location of direct quotations in the article and determine the stance of each quotation towards the given issue.
> Q5. Regarding the given issue, what is the stance of each quotation?  
> a. Supportive | b. Neutral | c. Oppositional
-   Not all quoted statements should be considered a stance. In an article about the issue \<Justice Minister Han Dong-hoon Proposes Relocating the National Assembly to Sejong City\>, Han's statement serves as a fact to support the journalist's perspective and is considered as neutral.
-   Exclude remarks unrelated to the issue or from a past time point.

### 4. Finally, determine the overall stance of the entire article body toward the given issue.

> Q6. What is the stance of the article body toward the issue?  
> a. Supportive | b. Neutral | c. Oppositional
-   The judgment should be based on the article body, not the headline.
-   The following are elements that reveal a biased stance in the news. You may consider these in your judgment:
    - Expression    
        - Reporting subjective opinion as objective fact.
        - Using specific words or adjectives to elicit an emotional response from the reader.
        - Reinforcing a particular viewpoint with exaggeration and emotional language.
        - Speculative descriptions that assert a specific person's inner thoughts or intentions without objective evidence.
    - Information selection
        - Selectively providing only certain information to induce support for one side.
        - Intentionally omitting certain information to guide the reader's perspective in a specific direction.
        - Intentionally selecting sources to reinforce a specific narrative (e.g., covering an environmental issue by only quoting corporate officials).
        - Using vague language without clearly identifying the source (e.g., "according to an official").
        - Including numerous quotations from one side while minimizing the opposing view.
    - Framing
        - Shaping bias through the overall context and narrative direction of the article.
        - Guiding a specific interpretation after introducing a quotation.
        - Presenting a specific commentary at the end of the article to reinterpret previous information from a particular viewpoint.
        - Manipulating the perception of importance through the order of information presentation (e.g., placing biased information in the lead).
